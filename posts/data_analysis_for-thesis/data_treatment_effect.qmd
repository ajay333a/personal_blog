## Effect of Treatments on leaves to produce roots

An experiment was conducted to find the rooting potential of the leaves mainly angiosperms to root when treated with different phyto-hormones.

![](bar_plot_1.png)

-   In the experiment, 4 treatments were applied on 8 different species, and the observations included:
    -   Number of roots (`num_roots_n`).
    -   Length of the longest root in centimeters (`lng_long_root_cm`).
    -   Diameter of the longest root in millimeters (`dia_long_root_mm`).

#### Loading Required packages

```{r Loading libraries}
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(gt)

```

#### Loading the data and formatting

The data is loaded as a dataframe `thesisdata` and columns such as treatments(`Treatment`) and species(`Species`) are changes to factors as they are not suitable as strings.

```{r Loading data}
# Loading data
thesisdata <- read_csv("thesisdata.csv",
                       show_col_types = FALSE)
# formating data
ths_data <- thesisdata
ths_data$Treatment <- as.factor(ths_data$Treatment)
ths_data$Treatment <- 
  factor(ths_data$Treatment,levels = c("Control",
                                       "Coconut water", 
                                       "IBA 1000ppm",
                          "IBA 100ppm + Coconut water"))
ths_data$Species <- factor(ths_data$Species)

ths_data %>% head()
```

-   Confirming that only 8 species and 4 treatments are used in the experiment.

```{r unique treatments and species}

treatments_and_species <- list(unique(ths_data$Treatment), unique(ths_data$Species))

names(treatments_and_species) <- c("Treatment", "Species")
treatments_and_species
```

### Aggregating data and formatting the results into a table.

The data is aggregated in @tbl-aggregate-summary by the average of root lengths with standard deviation(SD)

```{r Summary_Table, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-aggregate-summary
#| tbl-cap: Aggregating data and finding average of each parameter by species and treatment

ths_data_1 <- ths_data %>% group_by(Species, Treatment) %>% 
  summarise(avg_n_roots = mean(num_roots_n),
            SD_n_roots = sd(num_roots_n),
            avg_lng_root = mean(lng_long_root_cm),
            SD_lng_root = sd(lng_long_root_cm),
            avg_dia_root = mean(dia_long_root_mm),
            SD_dia_root = sd(dia_long_root_mm)) %>%
  # rounding of to 2 digits  
  mutate(across(where(is.double), ~round(., digits = 2))) %>%
  # combining means and SD into a single column
  unite(avg_n_roots_SD, avg_n_roots, SD_n_roots, sep = " \u00b1 ") %>%
  unite(avg_lng_root_SD, avg_lng_root, SD_lng_root, sep = " \u00b1 ") %>% 
  unite(avg_dia_root_SD, avg_dia_root, SD_dia_root, sep = " \u00b1 ") %>%
  # using 'gt' package to get a table  
  gt(rowname_col = "Treatment") %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "Thesis Data of the Species",
    subtitle = "Influence of growth regulators on the root generation"
  ) %>% 
  opt_align_table_header(align = "center") %>% 
  cols_label( # renaming columns
    avg_n_roots_SD = md("Mean number of roots \u00b1 SD"), #md is markdown language
    avg_lng_root_SD = md("Mean length of longest roots \u00b1 SD (cm)"),
    avg_dia_root_SD = md("Mean diameter of  longest roots \u00b1 SD (mm)")
  ) %>% # fixing columns width
  cols_width(Treatment ~ px(150),
             avg_n_roots_SD ~ px(150),
             avg_lng_root_SD ~ px(150),
             avg_dia_root_SD ~ px(150),
            ) %>% 
  cols_align(align = "center")

ths_data_1
```

### Plotting the data for better understanding.

-   Plotting a bar graph @fig-treatment-effect to see how each treatment performed on each species.

```{r bar-graph, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, dpi=180}
#| label: fig-treatment-effect
#| fig-cap: Influence of pytohormone treatments on leaves of different species

ths_data |> summarise(avg_n_roots = mean(num_roots_n),
                      avg_lng_root = mean(lng_long_root_cm),
                      avg_dia_root = mean(dia_long_root_mm),
                      .by = c(Species, Treatment)) %>%
  rename("Mean number of Roots" = avg_n_roots,
         "Mean length of Longest root(cm)" = avg_lng_root,
         "Mean diameter of Longest roots(mm)" = avg_dia_root) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(c("Mean number of Roots", "Mean length of Longest root(cm)",
                        "Mean diameter of Longest roots(mm)")) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Species, y = value, fill = name)) + 
  geom_col(alpha = 0.7, position = "dodge") + 
  facet_wrap(~Treatment, ncol = 2) + 
  theme_bw() + labs(y = " ", fill = "Parameters",
                    title = "Effect of treatments on rooting") +
 theme(legend.position = "bottom",
       axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
       plot.title = element_text(size = 18))

```

-   We can clearly see that *Control* treatment is not producing any roots in majority of the species.
-   **IBA 1000ppm** is clearly showing most promising results in most of the species in the graph.

### Finding correlation

We are going to filter out the control treatment as it is not significant at producing roots at all and plot @fig-root_length_vs_root_dia-scatterplot to find which treatment has better correlation at producing roots with higher diameters.

```{r co-relation_plot, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, dpi = 150}
#| label: fig-root_length_vs_root_dia-scatterplot
#| fig-cap: Plotting a scatter plot to find correlation between root lengths and diameters


ths_data |> filter(Treatment!= "Control") |> 
   ggplot(aes(x = lng_long_root_cm, y = dia_long_root_mm)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Treatment)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(group = Treatment, color = Treatment)) +
  labs(title = "Plotting Root length Vs Root Diameter",
       x = "Length of the longest root", 
       y = "Diameter of the longest root") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18))
```

-   The graph clearly shows that the `Coconut Water` treatment has the highest slope but other treatments which produced higher root lengths did not have a correlation as that of `Coconut Water` treatment.

### Statistical Analysis

Let's conduct a `anova` test on the data after filtering `Control` as it has not given any roots.

Let *H0* be Null hypothesis *H1* be Alternate hypothesis

```{r anova}
# ANOVA Model
model_anova <- ths_data %>%
  filter(Treatment != "Control") %>%
  aov(num_roots_n ~ Treatment, data = .)

# Summary
model_anova %>% summary()

# TukeyHSD
model_anova %>% TukeyHSD(conf.level = 0.95)
```

We can see from p adj that all the treatments means are different and we can reject the *H0*  hypothesis. *H1*  holds at 95% confidence interval.
